# Projects

For the last weeks of the semester, you will have to implement a mini-project in Simulink.

The project will be done individually.

The projects must be presented in the last week or during the exam session, before the exam.

# General Instructions

- During the last weeks, ask me and discuss any unclear requirement

- If anything seems overly complicated, ask me, I may simplify the requirement.

- Don't do too many tests for the model. Two or three are enough (e.g. some normal function and some error detection).

- In general, calibrate the total amount of work for the time available (approx. 3 sessions x 3 hours).
