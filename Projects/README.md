## Projects

For the last weeks of the semester, you will have to implement a mini-project in Simulink.

The project will be done individually.

The projects must be presented in the last week or during the exam session, before the exam.

## General Instructions

- Ask me and discuss any unclear requirement

- If anything seems overly complicated, ask me, I may simplify the requirement.

- Two or three tests are enough (e.g. some normal function and some error detection).

- In general, calibrate the total amount of work for the time available (approx. 4 sessions x 3 hours). 

## Deliverables
  
In the end you should hand over the following outputs

- The Simulink file (*.slx) of your model, containing a state machine implementing the functionality described in the project topic.

- A project report, containing:

  a. An overall description of the FSM design (how it works, the flow of states, transitions etc; whatever you find worth mentioning).
  b. Some tests of the functionality (2-3 tests, depending on complexity, covering normal usage and some error scenario)

     For each test, indicate:

     - The test description: what are the inputs, what are the expected outputs
     - The test results: include screenshots with the inputs and output signals (e.g. on a Scope), to prove the tests work


## Evaluation

- Based on completeness and correctness of the model & report (i.e. compliance with requirements)
- I will inspect (offline) the `*.slx` file and the report delivered and evaluate them
- We will have a small project presentation for each project:

  - the student presents the design of the model
  - I shall ask a couple of questions from the implementation
  - 5-10 mins per project, no slides, we discuss on the Simulink model, online
