## Projects

For the last weeks of the semester, you will have to implement a mini-project in Simulink.

The project will be done individually.

The projects must be presented in the last week or during the exam session, before the exam.

## General Instructions

- Ask me and discuss any unclear requirement

- If anything seems overly complicated, ask me, I may simplify the requirement.

- Two or three tests are enough (e.g. some normal function and some error detection).

- In general, calibrate the total amount of work for the time available (approx. 4 sessions x 3 hours). 

## Deliverables
  
In the end you should hand over the following outputs

- The Simulink file (*.slx) of your model

- The project report

## Evaluation

- We'll have a 10 minutes chat on the model, with 2-3 questions from the implementation inside
