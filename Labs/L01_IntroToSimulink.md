# Objective

Introducing students to the Simulink environment

# Theoretical aspects

Often used blocks:

  - In and Out ports
  - Switch
  - Constant
  - Logical operators
  - Relational operators
  - Sum / Product
  - Enabled subsystems
  - If / Action / Merge blocks
  - Model configuration parameters: solver step size
        

# Exercises

1. Create a Vehicle Speed Control system that satisfies the following requirements:

Requirements:

  1. Required interface
    - UserRequest
    - CurrentSpeed

  2. Provided interface
    - TargetSpeed

  3. Functional requirements

      1. When input UserRequest is ENUM_USERREQ_ACC, the output TargetSpeed will 
      shall be increase with acceleration P_MaxAccel
      2. When input UserRequest is ENUM_USERR




# Final questions

1. TBD
