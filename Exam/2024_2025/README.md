# 2024-2025 Exam Info

The exam is written, 2h, closed-book, and consists of an exercise (approx 50% of points) 
and a few (3-4)theoretical questions (the rest of 50% points). 

The exercise will be to draw the implementation of a small FSM and explain it in short,
e.g. something like a traffic light controller, thermostat with some options etc, 
like you did in the project (only much simpler than the project, of course).

The theoretical questions will be from a list of predefined questions in this folder
(see file [`SubjectsList.pdf`](SubjectsList.pdf) ), which cover pretty much all we discussed in the Lectures

A sample exam sheet is provided in the [`SampleExam`](../SampleExam) folder.
