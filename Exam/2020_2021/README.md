# 2020-2021 Exam Info

The written exam consists of a practical exercise (draw the implementation of a FSM from a few requirements, approx 50% of points) and a few theoretical questions (the rest of points). 

For the years up to 2021, there was a fixed list of possible subjects. This is not provided for 2021, since the exam is online. The exercise and the theoretical questions may change from the previous years (though you can use them as examples).
